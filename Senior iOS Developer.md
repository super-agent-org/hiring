We’re looking for a senior iOS developer to help us make our app better and continue to bring new features to Super Agent.
Here’s what we need from you:

Technical Requirements
-	Experience in Swift and SwiftUI
-	At least 2/3 published apps you can walk us through where you had significant contributions
-	Basic Javascript knowledge
-	Basic REST and GraphQL knowledge

Nice to have
-	AWS knowledge is a plus, but not required
-	Minimal Android (Java/Kotlin) or a cross platform technology like Flutter is a big plus, but definitely not a requirement
-	Understanding how browser extensions work and how they are built

Who you are
-	You thrive in being highly independent, working with minimal supervision
-	You take ownership of challenges and are quick to jump to action
-	You’re always ready to get out of your comfort zone to help someone in your team
-	You’re a great communicator, able to translate complex technical issues into plain and simple English
-	You focus on solutions more than you do on problems
-	You’re comfortable in guiding/mentoring less experienced peers

What you get
-	35k-50k/year
-	Equity
-	Unlimited vacation policy
-	Work from anywhere you want, anytime you want
-	Solve challenges the way you want, learning what you need to learn along the way
-	Be a part of a growing start-up and influence the web experience over 150k users have

We care more about you being someone we’d love to work with and someone who can’t wait to get their hands dirty than what you specifically know today.

You’ll have the freedom to work on your own terms, choosing solutions as you see fit with a very high degree of confidence.

Don’t be deterred if you don’t meet all the requirements - we’re looking forward to getting to know you!
